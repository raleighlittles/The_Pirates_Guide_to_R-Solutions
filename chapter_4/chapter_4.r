# Problem 2

## Rules about R variables, from https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/variable-constant/
## Identifiers can be a combination of letters, digits, period (.) and underscore (_).
## It must start with a letter or a period. If it starts with a period, it cannot be followed by a digit.
## Reserved words in R cannot be used as identifiers.

## Thus, only the 3rd and 7th variable declarations are invalid. 


# Problem 3
gold.2015 <- 100000

# Problem 4

gold.2015 <- gold.2015 + 800

# Problem 5
## In the 2nd statement, the result was never assigned to anything. So the value of a is still 10
